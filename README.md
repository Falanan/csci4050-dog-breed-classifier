## Dog Breed Classification using Transfer Learning

Our group did a comparative study of different neural networks. 
We compared ResNet and VGGNet by classifying dog breeds and plotting the accuracies of each network.
This repository contains code for the Jupyter Notebook, the saved ResNet models, and records from each training epoch.
We used the [Stanford Dogs Dataset](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/) in our training.
Also, there is code for identifying dog breeds given user image input (via the `my_dogs` directory).
